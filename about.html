      <h1>About the Photographer</h1>
      <p class="about-intro">
        Based in Orlando, Florida, I am a hobbyist photographer focusing on travel photos that tell a story with the technical excellence required for high-quality prints.
      </p>

          <p>
            This site houses the best of the best of my travel and landscape photography. Every image here is prepared using my personal artistic voice and vision with high‑quality printing
            in mind. In the field, I focus on time and place to create compositions that feel distinctive and memorable. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Crops and edits are done exclusively in Lightroom with no significant
            manipulation - everything you see qualifies for photography competitions (which I compete in!) where strict standards prohibiting excesssive post-processing are upheld.
         </p>
          <p>
            I’m working toward a streamlined print store, so you can order gallery‑quality pieces
            directly from each portfolio. Until then, feel free to reach out for custom sizes,
            licensing, or commissions.
