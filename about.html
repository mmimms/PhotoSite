      <h1>About the Photographer</h1>
      <p class="about-intro">
        Based in Kissimmee, Florida, I am a passionate photographer focusing on travel, landscape, and documentary work that tells a story with the technical excellence required for museum-quality prints.

            This portfolio houses the best of my travel and landscape photography. Every image here is prepared with my personal artistic vision and technical mastery in mind, with high-quality printing as the primary objective. In the field, I focus on composition, light, and moment to create images that feel distinctive and memorable.
          </p>

            All edits are done exclusively in Lightroom with minimal manipulation—everything you see qualifies for photography competitions where strict standards prohibiting excessive post-processing are upheld.

          <p>
            I'm building a streamlined print store so you can order gallery-quality pieces directly from each collection. In the meantime, feel free to reach out for custom sizes, licensing inquiries, or commission work.
